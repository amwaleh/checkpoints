# Dojo  Allocat


This module  randomly allocate space to a defined set of rooms
that can hold a given number of people.
Checkpoint1 module uses the `Space class` to generate and allocate rooms randomly.
	
	Space (Number of People, Room_Name, Number_of_Rooms)

### The Space class takes three optional params

	
	Number_of_people = maximum number a room can take.
	Room_Name 		 = The Name you want to allocate the room e.g. Office, Living etc
	Number_of_Rooms  = Number of rooms you want your building to have. 
	

###To create Rooms:

a. Instatiate the class with defaults parameters.
	
	roomspacs = Space()
	

This will create an Object with 1 space per room and will load rooms from the `room.txt` file located 
in the data folder (`data/room.txt`)

b. Pass the required parameters e.g.

	
	roomspacs = Space(3, 'mountain', 2)
	


This will create an object with 2 rooms prefixed with the Room_Param e.g `'Mountain 1'` and `'mountain 2'` as the room Name




##Room Allocation

1. Room Allocation can be done manually by calling the `room_allocate()` function

 	roomspacs.room_allocate('John Smith')

  This will randomly chose a vacant room and allocate the name 

2. Rooms can also be allocated from a file by evoking the `get_from_file()` function
	

	 details = roomspacs.get_from_file(r"allocation.txt")
	  for names in details:
	 		roomspacs.room_allocate(details[0])


Nb: files should have fields separated by space or tabs
