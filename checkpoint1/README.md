# Dojo Room Allocat


This module is used to Randomly allocate space to a defined set of rooms
that can hold a defined number of people.

# Usage

	
	`Space (Number of People, Room_Name, Number_of_Rooms)`

#The roomspacs takes three optional params

	```python
	Number_of_people = maximum number a room can take.
	Room_Name 		 = The Name you want to allocate the room e.g. Office, Living etc
	Number_of_Rooms  = Number of rooms you want your building to have. 
```

#To create Rooms:

Instatiate the class with defaults.
	
	`roomspacs = Space()`

	

 This will create an Object with 1 space per room and will load rooms from the 'room.txt' file 

 or  pass the required parameters
	
	`roomspacs = Space(3, 'mountain', 2)`
	

This will create Object with 2 rooms prefixed with the Room_Param e.g `'Mountain 1'` and `'mountain 2'` as the room Name



#Room Allocation
	1. Room Allocation can be done manually by calling the `room_allocate() function
	 
	 `roomspacs.room_allocate('John Smith')`

	This will randomly chose a vacant room and allocate the name 

	2. Rooms can also be allocated from a file by evoking the `get_from_file()` function
	
	 `roomspacs.get_from_file(r"allocation.txt")`
#Test
 To test out how the program works Run allocation.py
 		`>> python allocation.py`
 allocation module creates two instances

 1. Office reads room allocation from file 'rooms.txt'
		`>> office = Space(6)`
 2. living work space is generated by inputing the parameters
		`>>living = Space(4,'Living', 10)`


This method returns alist of all the file
