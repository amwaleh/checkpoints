# Dojo Room Allocat


This module is used to Randomly allocate space to a defined set of rooms
that can hold a defined number of people.

# Usage

	
	`Space (Number of People, Room_Name, Number_of_Rooms)`

#The roomspacs takes three optional params

	
	Number_of_people = maximum number a room can take.
	Room_Name 		 = The Name you want to allocate the room e.g. Office, Living etc
	Number_of_Rooms  = Number of rooms you want your building to have. 
	

#To create Rooms:


Instatiate the class with defaults.
	
	`roomspacs = Space()`

	

 This will create an Object with 1 space per room and will load rooms from the `'room.txt'` file 

 or  pass the required parameters

	
	roomspacs = Space(3, 'mountain', 2)
	


This will create Object with 2 rooms prefixed with the Room_Param e.g `'Mountain 1'` and `'mountain 2'` as the room Name




#Room Allocation

1. Room Allocation can be done manually by calling the `room_allocate()` function

 	roomspacs.room_allocate('John Smith')

  This will randomly chose a vacant room and allocate the name 

2. Rooms can also be allocated from a file by evoking the `get_from_file()` function
	

	 `roomspacs.get_from_file(r"allocation.txt")`

#Test

 To test out how the program works Run allocation.py
 		`>> python allocation.py`


Allocation.py Module
--------------------
 This moudule create two instance from the `Space()` Class

 NB : office reads room allocation from file `'rooms.txt'`

		office = Space(6)

 living work space is generated by inputing the parameters

		living = Space(4,'Living', 10)
